sentence=This library enables you to use Interrupt from Hardware Timers on an Arduino, such as Nano, UNO, Mega, Teensy, etc.
paragraph=It now supports 16 ISR-based timers, while consuming only 1 Hardware Timer. Timers' interval is very long (ulong millisecs). The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers. Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions or tasks. This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.
